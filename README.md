# Mute Plantronics headset

Pre-requisites:

  - Plantronics headset
  - Plantronics program must be running in the system tray.
  - The microphone must be in use, eg. you must be in conference call.

Ctrl-Alt-M toggles mute

Ctrl-Shift-Alt-M exits the program

Normally the tooltip on the system tray shows something like:

```Text

When the mute is on it says:

```Text
